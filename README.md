# Computational bioacoustics

Animal vocalisations and natural soundscapes are fascinating objects of study, and contain valuable evidence about animal behaviours, populations and ecosystems.
The study of the production, transmission, and reception of animal sounds in nature is called bioacoustics.
In particular, classification of the acoustic repertoires of animals into sound types is a useful tool for taxonomic studies, behavioral studies, and for documenting the occurrence of animals.
