# Computational bioacoustics
Animal vocalisations and natural soundscapes are fascinating objects of study, and
contain valuable evidence about animal behaviours, populations and ecosystems.
They are studied in bioacoustics and ecoacoustics, with signal processing and analysis
an important component.
