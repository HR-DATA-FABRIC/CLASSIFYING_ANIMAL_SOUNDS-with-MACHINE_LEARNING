## Computational bioacoustics

Animal vocalisations and natural soundscapes are fascinating objects of study, and contain valuable evidence about animal behaviours, populations and ecosystems.
The study of the production, transmission, and reception of animal sounds in nature is called bioacoustics.

In particular, classification of the acoustic repertoires of animals into sound types is a useful tool for taxonomic studies, behavioral studies, and for documenting the occurrence of animals.

## Acoustic Monitoring of Bat sounds

Understanding bat populations and behavior is crucial for their conservation, but these nocturnal creatures are difficult to study directly. Their speed, nighttime activity, and preferred habitats make traditional observation methods impractical. Nonetheless, bats use ultrasonic sounds for navigation, making passive acoustic monitoring powerful tool for bat research.
 

## Scalogram-Based Deep Learning Approach 

In the exciting new world of Artificial Intelligence (AI), deep learing-based computer vision (CV)   lets computers "see" and classify images. But what if could applied CV to "hear"  and classify sounds? 

Audio classification with CV marries the two domains by applying the principles of visual understanding to audio data. It leverages deep learning techniques to "see" sound, just as it would with images. This innovation has opened doors to a plethora of applications that were once out of reach.
